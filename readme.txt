Slideshow plugin with cover flow effect.

== Description ==

ImageFlow shows a gallery of images with the cover flow effect, this plugin has an options page where 
you be able to create the look you need.

[Finn Rudolph](http://finnrudolph.de/ImageFlow "Finn Rudolph"), is the creator of JavaScipt code necessary for this effect to work and because there are 
a few options that are difficult to explain is better if you take a look at your website and review 
the [examples](http://finnrudolph.de/ImageFlow/Examples "examples") he has.

You will notice that not all options that exist within the javascript plugin are included within the wordpress plugin, 
that is for lack of time, but will be available in the future.

So for now I hope this helps someone else.
